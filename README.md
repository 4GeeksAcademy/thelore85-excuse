# Template Vanilla Web App

**Description:**
This project is a Vanilla JavaScript application structured in modules and bundled using Webpack. It serves as a starting point for building web applications with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How It Works

1. **Clone the Repository:** You can clone this repository using the `git clone` command or download it as a ZIP file.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

3. **Development Mode:** Start the development server with `npm start`. This will launch the app in your default web browser and provide hot-reloading during development.

4. **Production Build:** When you're ready to deploy your app, use `npm run build` to create a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

5. **Customize and Expand:** You can modify the existing code or add your own modules to tailor the application to your specific needs.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your system to manage dependencies and run scripts.

## Project Structure

- `src` directory: Contains the source code of the application.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your app.
  - `index.js`: The main JavaScript file that initializes your app and imports modules.
  - `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling your application.
  - `modules/`: This directory is where you can create and organize your JavaScript modules.
- `dist` directory: Contains the bundled and optimized production-ready code generated by Webpack.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this template to meet your project's requirements. Add new modules, styles, or assets as needed. Use the provided development server and build tools to streamline your workflow.
